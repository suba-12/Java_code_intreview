 Difference Of Sum
Q.6. Write a function differenceofSum(a,b) which will take two integers as an argument.
 Youâ€™ve to obtain the total of all the integers ranging from 1 to n (both inclusive) that are not divisible by b.
  You should also return the distinction between the sum of the integers which are not divisible by b
 with the sum of the integers divisible by b?

Consider: a and b are greater than 0. i.e a>0 and b>0. And their sum should lies between the integral range.

Sample Test Case 1:

Input:

a = 6 and b = 30

Output:

285
